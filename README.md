# MM-Module-List

3rd party module list for [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror).

This repository is a list of modules that are not included in the default MagicMirror² installation. Now the official list of 3rd party modules is maintained in the MagicMirror² wiki. This repository is an attempt replace the old list of 3rd party modules with a more structured and maintainable approach.

## Disadvantages of the old list

The old list of 3rd party modules was a single markdown file that was hard to maintain. It was hard to find modules and it was hard to keep the list up-to-date. This repository is an attempt to solve these problems.

## Goals of this repository

- Make it easy to add new modules
- Make it easy to update existing modules
- Make it easy to mark modules as outdated
- Make it easy to remove outdated modules
- Make it easy to use the list in other projects (by providing a JSON file)

## How to add a new module (work in progress)

To add a new module, you just have to open an issue and use the add template. The template will ask you for all the necessary information. After you have filled out the template, submit the issue and wait for a maintainer to add the module.

## How to update an existing module (planed)

To update an existing module, you just have to open an issue and use the update template. The template will ask you for all the necessary information. After you have filled out the template, submit the issue and wait for a maintainer to update the module.

## How to mark a module as outdated (planed)

If you think a module is outdated, you can open an issue and use the outdated template. The template will ask you for all the necessary information. After you have filled out the template, submit the issue and wait for a maintainer to mark the module as outdated.

## How to remove a module (planed)

Only in rare cases, a module should be removed. The usual way for a outdated or not working module is to mark it as outdated.
